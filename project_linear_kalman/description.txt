Linear Kalman Filter 

In this project , we implement a linear Kalman filter to observe and estimate the real output and states values
of a linear discrete time system , which is in discrete state-space form . The project consists of two functions , one
for the Linear Kalman Filter algorithm and one for the addition of noise in the states and in the observations , which
are needed to represent the real system . The project also has a main script , where we apply the two functions to a 
linear system we made , to simulate the Kalman Filtering process . The functions can be used in any other linear system in discrete
state-space form , so feel free to test the above algorithms to your own system.

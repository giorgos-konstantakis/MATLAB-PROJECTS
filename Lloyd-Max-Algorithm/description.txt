Lloyd-Max algorithm for non-uniform PCM coding

In this project , we developed the Lloyd-Max algorithm to find the optimal quantization levels of a PCM coding process , for a
variety of bits ( N = 4,8 bits etc ). The algorithm calculates not only the output quantized signal , but also useful information
of the process , such as the mean distortion at every iteration of the algorithm , the entropy and the SQNR of the signal etc.
Also we have deveoped the theoritical Lloyd-Max algorithm for the special case where the input signal's PDF ( probability density
function ) is Gaussian , with specific mean and variance values.

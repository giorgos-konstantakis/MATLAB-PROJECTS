Developing a system to perform M-FSK modulation to transmit information ( bits ) through a channel

In this project , we developed the M-FSK modulation algorithm , in order to simulate the transmission of big sequences of bits through 
a channel and calculate the error between the original signal and the signal after the modulation. The user can simulate an M-FSK system
for 4 symbols  (M=4,1 symbol per 2 bits) , 8 symbols (M=8,1 symbol per 3 bits) and 16 symbols (M=16,1 symbol per 4 bits). There are 
instructions as comments in the code on how to use it.
